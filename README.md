# goge-bin-finder

This is one library in a set to interact with the dogecoin(and others) core library/cli.

This package/library is made to find the dogecoin core binaries and make alias links to them to wrap our own commands.

The bin-finder/alias creator has completed 65% of the intened core features.

# Use-case

- You want to interact with the dogecoin core commands programatically, and not just in the CLI.

- You want a simple alias wrapper for your cli commands

- You are writting bigger projects with dogecoin, and want a wrapper and API written in golang to impliment all the dogecoin core features, but don't want to work with dogecoin-cli/d directly or c++
- You want a simple API to interact with dogecoin by just plugging in your node link
- You want to use our dogecoin node
- You like the dogecoin



# Development progress

Currently the entire goge-lib is in heavy and early delopment. 

```The bin-finder/alias creator Is almost complete ```

# goge-lib-family

- There will also be a CLI wrapper [(Future Link)](https://radroutes.com) That will wrap dogecoind, dogecoin-cli...etc, with goge commands.
 
- Work on the API has begun with the [Fiber framework](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) to interact with the goge-wrapper.
