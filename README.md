# goge-bin-finder

This is one library in a set to interact with the dogecoin(and others) core library/cli.

This package/library is made to find the dogecoin core binaries and make alias links to them to wrap our own commands.

The bin-finder/alias creator has completed 65% of the intened core features.

# Use-case

- You want to interact with the dogecoin core commands programatically, and not just in the CLI.

- You want a simple alias wrapper for your cli commands

- You are writting bigger projects with dogecoin, and want a wrapper and API written in golang to impliment all the dogecoin core features, but don't want to work with dogecoin-cli/d directly or c++
- You want a simple API to interact with dogecoin by just plugging in your node link
- You want to use our dogecoin node
- You like the dogecoin



# Installation
If you would like to run the go files, you will need to have Golang installed, otherwise you can run the windows executable.

Check the main() and params to make sure it is searching for what you want.

If you would like to join the project, or just meme on us, send an email at [gogelib@gmail.com](gogelib@gmail.com)

# Run
There are Windows executables already built or you can run 
```
go build ./
```
to build the executable for your platform, and then run it on your system.
# goge-lib-family

- There will also be a CLI wrapper [(Future Link)](https://radroutes.com) That will wrap dogecoind, dogecoin-cli...etc, with goge commands.
 
- Work on the API has begun with the [Fiber framework](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) to interact with the goge-wrapper.
